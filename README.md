Program overview:
This program was written to implement a simple version of command shell called rshell.
Rshell can support simple inputs similar to those used in BASH command shell.
It makes commands call through the use of the execvp function and uses a build in exit command to shotdown the program.

Bugs:
1. && and || work as if ;
2. cd does not function
